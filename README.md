# DE4---SIOT
Design Engineering Sensing &amp; The Internet of Things Module respository.

Welcome to my Github Respository for the SIOT Module in Design Engineering.

For the execution of this code you will need to download the entire file which contains all of the scripts.

The key scripts of interest are:

- Data_Collection.ipynb
- Data_Analysis_Final.ipynb
- HealthData.csv

The first is to execute the start of the data collection and upload the csv to google sheets and the second is to analyse the data. The scripts are both Jupyter Notebook files and should be run through Anaconda for maximum user experience.
